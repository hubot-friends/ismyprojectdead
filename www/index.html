<h2>Story</h2>
<p>I took over the maintenance of Hubot and started to realize that it was dead.</p>
<ol>
    <li>If you go to a website that's using your project was last updated 2014-08-01 22:17, then it's probably dead.</li>
    <li>If the thing that's using your project is using CoffeeScript, <s>it's probably dead</s> it might be alive and kicking but including a dependency that includes CoffeeScript (i.e. cypress, babel, testcafe).</li>
    <li>If you do 7 releases in 3 months and only 3 people post anything about it on your GitHub repo, it's probably dead.</li>
</ol>
